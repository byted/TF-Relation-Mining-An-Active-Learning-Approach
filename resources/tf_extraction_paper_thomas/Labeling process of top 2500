# Labeling process of top 2500

* no simple labeling, just TP, FP and NN from output of old classifier
* reduce to 0/1 for evaluation

`
label == TP ->   1
label == FP ->   0
label == NN ->   1 if details == 'cooperation/competition in transcription'
        0 else
`
That works with the numbers from the paper:
`
2500 gesamt
2500-1625 = 875 in databases und TP
660 additional TP
322 cooperative/competition -> NN &&? 'cooperation/competition in transcription'
643 FP
