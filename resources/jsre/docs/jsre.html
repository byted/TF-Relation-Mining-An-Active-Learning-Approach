<h1>jSRE - java Simple Relation Extraction</h1>

<p align="justify">jSRE is an open source Java tool for <em>Relation Extraction</em>.
It is based on a supervised machine learning approach which is applicable even when (deep) linguistic processing is not available or reliable.
In particular, jSRE uses a combination of kernel functions to integrate two different information sources: (i) the whole sentence where the relation appears, and (ii) the local contexts around the interacting entities.
jSRE requires only a shallow linguistic processing, such as tokenization, sentence splitting, Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging and lemmatization.</p>

<p align="justify">The core of jSRE is primarily developed by <a href="mailto:giuliano@itc.it">Claudio Giuliano</a> at <a href="http://www.itc.it/irst/">ITC-IRST</a>, <a href="http://tcc.itc.it/">Cognitive and Communication Technologies</a> division.</p>

<p align="justify">jSRE is released as free software with full source code,

<p align="justify">Some of jSRE's features include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Implements the class of shallow linguistic kernels</li>
	<li>Written in Java, so it runs on Mac OS X, OS/2, Unix, VMS and Windows</li>
	<li>Abstract kernel and data representation interfaces</li>
	<li>Supports user-defined data representation</li>
</ul>


<p align="justify">The latest version of jSRE is 1.1, released 28 August 2006. To download, install and run it go to the <a href="jsre/user-guide-1.1.html">User's Guide</a>.</p>
