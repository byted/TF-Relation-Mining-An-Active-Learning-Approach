  abstract = {The biomedical literature can be seen as a large integrated, but unstructured data repository. Extracting facts from literature and making them accessible is approached from two directions: manual curation efforts develop ontologies and vocabularies to annotate gene products based on statements in papers. Text mining aims to automatically identify entities and their relationships in text using information retrieval and natural language processing techniques. Manual curation is highly accurate but time consuming, and does not scale with the ever increasing growth of literature. Text mining as a high-throughput computational technique scales well, but is error-prone due to the complexity of natural language. How can both be married to combine scalability and accuracy? Here, we review the state-of-the-art text mining approaches that are relevant to annotation and discuss available online services analysing biomedical literature by means of text mining techniques, which could also be utilised by annotation projects. We then examine how far text mining has already been utilised in existing annotation projects and conclude how these techniques could be tightly integrated into the manual annotation process through novel authoring systems to scale-up high-quality manual curation.},

  abstract = {WordNet, an electronic lexical database, is considered to be the most important resource available to researchers in computational linguistics, text analysis, and many related areas. Its design is inspired by current psycholinguistic and computational theories of human lexical memory. English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are organized into synonym sets, each representing one underlying lexicalized concept. Different relations link the synonym sets. The purpose of this volume is twofold. First, it discusses the design of WordNet and the theoretical motivations behind it. Second, it provides a survey of representative applications, including word sense identification, information retrieval, selectional preferences of verbs, and lexical chains.},
